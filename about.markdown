## About Jackson & Son's Property Management

Just a passion that turned into a dream come true. Jackson & Son's Property Management started out with a mower and a trailer and has successfully added commercial and residential accounts that satisfy weekly. My name is Cody R. Jackson and I have been living in the community for 26 years. I graduated from Kenton Ridge High School and currently live in Champaign County. I love property management and I always strive to bring my best work to your home/business.

#### Where we are now

Growing has been the name of the game. I am always looking for new accounts, both residential and commercial, and would love to chat with you about those services. I have started excavation/irrigation for the 2021 year and  I look forward to transforming your property into the place of your dreams. I specialize in weekly mowing contracts, irrigation routes, fire pits, patios, landscape design, and minor hardscape. We can do driveway grading, skid steer work, and minor excavation. I look forward to many successful years in business and hope you reach out if we can help you. Clark, Champaign, and Montgomery counties are as far as we travel at this time.
